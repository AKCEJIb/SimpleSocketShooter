## Game Info
* This project is a game, based on sockets and using winforms to draw things (yeah it's ugly).
* To host a new server you should launch a game with args:
  * `.\SimpleSocketShooter.exe -server -port 23333` - launch a server on port 23333. You can choose any port what you ever want :)
  * `.\SimpleSocketShooter.exe -server` - launch a server on default game port `23333`.
 * When you launch a game, put down server ip address in right bottom field and press `ИГРАТЬ!` button.
